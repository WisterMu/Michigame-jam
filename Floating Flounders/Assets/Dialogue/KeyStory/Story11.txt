Rovin: I bet if he took Mithya and Cassian away, he might be able to bring them back.
Kai: Good idea. I still have no idea who you’re talking about, but if giving that guy another thrashing gives you some closure, I’m all for it. //Emote Neutral
Julian: I’m more than happy to be your cheerleader…after a quick nap. Ugh. //Emote Neutral

Rovin: Don’t worry, I’ll give ‘em a piece of my mind! //Emote Angry
