Yuxero: I have to say, I hate what you’ve done with the place. There’s no rhyme or reason to where you’ve put anything, I mean just look at those paintings. They’re crooked! //Emote Angry
Kai: Ro, do you know this guy? //Emote Confused
Rovin: I don’t care. No one insults my living room while trying to erase my friend and gets away with it!
